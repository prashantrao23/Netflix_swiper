# Netflix_swiper
Created with CodeSandbox

Hey folks,

Can someone help me create this swiper just like a netflix one. I'm halfway through, but when im hovering over the card, the whole swiper is getting disturbed.

One solution is that - If we give a fixed height to swiper it will work, but when we minimize the screen the cards are getting streched down with the swiper height.
I dont want to give fix height. so that it can be a resposive.


Is there anyway to fix this??
